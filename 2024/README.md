# Getting started

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using `tsx`, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) installed. `tsx` is designed to be compatible with all maintained versions of Node.js. You'll need to execute it with [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx).

To run any file in the project, you can use the following command:

```sh
npx tsx path/to/file
```
